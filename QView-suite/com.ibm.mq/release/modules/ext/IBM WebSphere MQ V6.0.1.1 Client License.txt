International Program License Agreement 

Part 1 - General Terms 

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, 

- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND 

- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT. 

"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries. 

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ . The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program. 

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation. 

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for warranty, future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity. 

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the terms of the latter agreement prevail. 

1. Entitlement 

License 

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. 

IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully acquire it. 

You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program. 

If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another party. 

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of this Agreement. 

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program. 

IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its PoE. 

Money-back Guarantee 

If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund. 

Program Transfer 

You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. When You transfer the Program, You must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, including the Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program. 

2. Charges 

The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. 

One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement. 

If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You acquired it and pay any applicable charges. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that You acquire it. 

3. Limited Warranty 

IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating environment it will conform to its specifications. The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct all Program defects. You are responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program. 

IBM provides You with access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses at no additional charge. Consult the IBM Software Support Guide for further information at http://www.ibm.com/software/support . IBM will maintain this information for at least one year after the original licensee acquires the Program ("Warranty Period"). 

If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, You may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired it and receive a refund in the amount You paid. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund. 

THESE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD.

THESE WARRANTIES GIVE YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. 

4. Limitation of Liability 

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, You are entitled to recover damages from IBM. In each such instance, regardless of the basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the charges for the Program that is the subject of the claim. 

This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are collectively responsible. 

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 

1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

2. special, indirect, or consequential loss; or 

3. loss of profits, business, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings.

Third Party Code 

The Program and future updates and fixpacks to the Program may contain certain third party components which are provided to You under terms and conditions which are different from this Agreement, or which require IBM or third parties that provide IBM products ("Third Parties") to provide You with certain notices and/or information. For each such third party component, either IBM or Third Parties will identify such third party component in a "README" file (or in an updated "README" file accompanying the fixpack or update), or in a file or files referenced in such "README" files (and shall include any associated license agreement, notices and other related information therein), or the third party component will contain or be accompanied by its own license agreement (for example, provided when installing or starting such component, or accompanying such component in a file entitled "README", "COPYING", "LICENSE" or a substantially similar title, or included among the Program's paper documentation, if any). Your use of each third party component which contains or is accompanied by its own license agreement, or for which IBM or Third Parties have identified a license agreement in one of the above "README" files (or in a file or files referenced therein), will be subject to the terms and conditions of such other license agreement, and not this Agreement. By using or not uninstalling such third party components after the initial installation of such third party components (thereby giving You access to the applicable license agreements, notices and information), You acknowledge and agree to all such license agreements, notices and information, including those provided only in the English language. You agree to review any updated "README" files which accompany updates and fixpacks to the Program.

Sub-Capacity Terms for zSeries Programs 

Refer to the "IPLA Amendment for zSeries Platform Programs Sub-Capacity Pricing" to determine applicable sub-capacity terms. 

Program-unique Terms 

1. Charging and License Use Management 

Charges for authorized use of the Program are based on Processor License Units (PLUs). The use of the Program on any server machine or extended transactional client requires one PLU to be acquired (from IBM or an IBM Business Partner) for each processor core contained in the machine on which any copy of the Program (with the exception of other client components, remote administration, or sample programs) is to run. PLUs are required for every server machine on which the Program is installed. You are also required to obtain a corresponding number of additional PLUs if the Program installation is moved to a server machine with a greater number of processor cores or if any additional processor cores are added to, or configured on, the server machine on which the Program is installed. 

Failure to comply with requirement for the appropriate number of PLUs will invalidate the terms of this license. 

No separate server or client authorizations are required to license any other component part of the Program, including the Information Center and the MQ Explorer. 

You should retain all Passport Advantage documents as Proofs of Entitlement. 

2. Specific restrictions also apply to various components of the Program, as described below.
